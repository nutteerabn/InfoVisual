    The goal of this visualization is to understand how viewers engage with a video by examining where and how they focus their attention.
    
    By comparing the areas where viewers look (represented by convex and concave hulls), the visualization highlights whether their attention stays focused on a specific part of the video or shifts around.

    Ultimately, this visualization helps us uncover patterns of focus and exploration, providing insights into how viewers interact with different elements of the video.

    Convex Hull wraps all gaze points to show the outer boundary of visual spread.  
    Concave Hull follows the true shape of gaze clusters more tightly.
    Comparing their areas helps us quantify how focused or dispersed the gaze is.
